Explanation of Changes:
Error Handling: Added a log_error function to log errors to a file (error_log.txt) instead of just printing them.
Skipping Rows with Missing Fields: Added a check to skip rows where the email field is missing.
Modular Functions: Separated the error logging into its own function (log_error) to improve readability and maintainability.
